A lightweight, file-based feature flag system for Python applications. This is a Python implementation inspired by the [ffxl](https://github.com/57uff3r/ffxl) TypeScript library.

## Features

- **Time-based activation** - Schedule features to be enabled from a specific date/time (UTC)
- **Gradual rollout** - Enable features for a percentage of users (10%, 50%, 100%, etc.)
- **Environment-based control** - Different rollout percentages per environment
- User-specific feature flag access control
- YAML-based configuration stored locally

## Frequently asked questions
### Why feature flags are stored in a file and not in cloud?
Storing feature flags in a file provides simplicity, ease of use, and version control.
It allows developers to manage feature flags alongside their codebase without relying on external services. 
This approach is ideal for small to medium-sized projects or when you want to avoid the complexity and cost of cloud-based solutions. 
Additionally, file-based configurations can be easily reviewed, audited, and rolled back using standard version control systems like Git.

### I need to deploy to control feature flag?
Mostly yes, aim to keep deployment process fast and simple.
Or you could use gradual rollout and timebased activation to minimize the need for frequent deployments.


## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install ffxl-p
```

```bash
uv add ffxl-p
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a configuration file

Create `feature-flags.yaml`:

```yaml
features:
  new_dashboard:
    enabled: true
    comment: "New dashboard UI"

  beta_feature:
    enabled: false
    comment: "Beta feature - not ready yet"

  admin_panel:
    onlyForUserIds:
      - "user-123"
      - "user-456"
    comment: "Admin panel - restricted access"

  allow_mock_payments:
    enabled: true
    environments: ["dev"]
    comment: "Mock payments only in development"

  experimental_feature:
    rollout:
      dev: 100
      production: 5
    comment: "Cautious rollout - 5% in production"
```

### 2. Use in your code

```python
from ffxl_p import load_feature_flags, is_feature_enabled, User

# Load configuration
load_feature_flags(environment='production') # or get name of your environment from env variables

# Check global feature
if is_feature_enabled('new_dashboard'):
    print("Show new dashboard")

# Check user-specific feature
user = "user-123"
if is_feature_enabled('admin_panel', user):
    print("Show admin panel")

# Or use a dict
if is_feature_enabled('admin_panel', 'user-456'):
    print("Show admin panel")
```

## Configuration Format

### Global Enabled/Disabled
If feature is disabled then its is off regardless other options. It's global parameter.

```yaml
features:
  feature_name:
    enabled: true  # or false
    comment: "Optional description"
```

### User-Specific Access

```yaml
features:
  feature_name:
    onlyForUserIds:
      - "user-1"
      - "user-2"
    comment: "Only for specific users"
```

When `onlyForUserIds` is present and populated, it takes precedence over the `enabled` setting.

### Environment-Based Access

Control which environments a feature is enabled in:

```yaml
features:
  debug_mode:
    enabled: true
    environments: ["dev"]
    comment: "Only in development"

  staging_feature:
    enabled: true
    environments: ["dev", "staging"]
    comment: "Dev and staging only"

  production_feature:
    enabled: true
    environments: ["production"]
    comment: "Production only"
```

### Time-Based Activation

Control when features are enabled using start and/or end dates (UTC):

```yaml
features:
  # Feature enabled from a specific date
  upcoming_feature:
    enabled: true
    enabledFrom: "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z"
    comment: "Will be enabled on December 1st, 2025"

  # Feature enabled until a specific date
  limited_time_offer:
    enabled: true
    enabledUntil: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
    comment: "Holiday promotion ending December 31st"

  # Feature with a time window (both start and end)
  beta_testing:
    enabled: true
    enabledFrom: "2025-11-15T00:00:00Z"
    enabledUntil: "2025-12-15T00:00:00Z"
    comment: "One-month beta testing period"

  # Combine with environment restrictions
  scheduled_production_release:
    enabled: true
    enabledFrom: "2025-11-20T14:30:00+00:00"
    environments: ["production"]
    comment: "Production release scheduled for November 20th at 2:30 PM UTC"
```

**How it works:**
- Accepts ISO 8601 datetime strings in UTC timezone
- `enabledFrom`: Feature is disabled if current time is before this date
- `enabledUntil`: Feature is disabled if current time is after this date
- Both can be used together to create a time window
- Supports both 'Z' suffix and '+00:00' for UTC timezone
- Time checks are evaluated before environment, rollout, and user restrictions

**Example usage:**
```python
from ffxl_p import load_feature_flags, is_feature_enabled

load_feature_flags()

# Will return False before enabledFrom, True after
if is_feature_enabled('upcoming_feature'):
    show_new_feature()

# Will return True before enabledUntil, False after
if is_feature_enabled('limited_time_offer'):
    show_promotion()

# Will return True only within the time window
if is_feature_enabled('beta_testing'):
    enable_beta_features()
```

### Gradual Rollout (Percentage-Based)

Enable features for a percentage of users in each environment:

```yaml
features:
  new_feature:
    rollout:
      dev: 100        # 100% in dev
      staging: 50     # 50% in staging
      production: 10  # 10% in production
    comment: "Gradual rollout - start small, expand carefully"

  experimental_feature:
    rollout:
      dev: 100
      staging: 25
      production: 5
    comment: "Cautious rollout - 5% in production"
```

**How it works:**
- Uses consistent hashing (SHA256) of `feature_name + user_id`
- Same user always gets same result for same feature
- Different features have independent distributions
- **Requires user** - percentage rollout only works when a user is provided

NOTE: 10% won't mean exactly 10 users out of 100 will get feature, it might be 11 or 9, but statistically over a large number of users it will approximate that.

**Example usage:**
```python
from ffxl_p import load_feature_flags, is_feature_enabled, User

load_feature_flags(environment='production') # or get name of your environment from env variables

user = "user-123"
if is_feature_enabled('new_feature', user):
    # This user is in the 10% rollout group
    show_new_feature()
```

### Combined Restrictions

Combine environment restrictions with percentage rollout:

```yaml
features:
  advanced_feature:
    environments: ["staging", "production"]
    rollout:
      staging: 100    # All users in staging
      production: 25  # 25% of users in production
    comment: "Full staging test, then 25% production rollout"
```

**Priority Order:**
1. Global `enabled` flag check (if `enabled: false`, feature is disabled regardless of other settings)
2. Time-based activation check (if `enabledFrom` and/or `enabledUntil` is specified)
3. Environment check (if `environments` is specified)
4. Percentage rollout (if `rollout` is specified, **requires user**)
5. User-specific list (if `onlyForUserIds` is specified)
6. Global `enabled` flag (defaults to `false` if not specified)

## API Reference

### Loading Configuration

```python
# Load from default location (./feature-flags.yaml)
load_feature_flags()

# Load with explicit environment
load_feature_flags(environment='production')

# Load from custom path
load_feature_flags('./config/flags.yaml', environment='staging')

# Load as JSON string (for environment variables)
config_string = load_feature_flags_as_string()
```

### Feature Checks

```python
# Check single feature
is_feature_enabled('feature_name', user)

# Check if ANY features are enabled
is_any_feature_enabled(['feature1', 'feature2'], user)

# Check if ALL features are enabled
are_all_features_enabled(['feature1', 'feature2'], user)
```

### Getting Features

```python
# Get all enabled features for a user
enabled = get_enabled_features(user)  # Returns: ['feature1', 'feature2']

# Get multiple feature flags as dict
flags = get_feature_flags(['feature1', 'feature2'], user)
# Returns: {'feature1': True, 'feature2': False}
```

### Utility Functions

```python
# Check if feature exists
feature_exists('feature_name')

# Get all feature names
get_all_feature_names()

# Get feature configuration
get_feature_config('feature_name')
```

## Environment Variables

### Custom Configuration File

```bash
# Option 1
export FFXL_FILE=./config/flags.yaml

# Option 2
export FEATURE_FLAGS_FILE=./config/flags.yaml
```
